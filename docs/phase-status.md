# Implementation status

## Phase 0 — Complete (fixture-only feasibility)

**Date:** September 29, 2026.

**Delivered:** Hardware inventory; project-local environment and `uv.lock`; dependency/license manifest; hash-verified llama.cpp b11247 and Qwen3-4B Q4_K_M weights; bounded local planner configuration; optional disabled vision path; bundled storefront, proxy, and disallowed-service sentinel; browser-use read-only DOM adapter using the same target as Playwright; observed-candidate action registry; memory sampling; detailed offline reports; browser/generated-code isolation design; setup and execution instructions.

**Acceptance check:** One bundled Phase 0 scenario after construction. Initial lint identified five findings; they were fixed and only the affected file was rechecked. The browser/model scenario passed on its first execution; no full-suite or repeated browser runs were performed.

**Result:** 16/16 checks passed. Qwen selected Start checkout; Playwright reached Order review. Sentinel received zero requests. Service workers absent. Model startup 4.19 s, decision 8.55 s, complete scenario 16.84 s. Peak combined monitored RSS 5.311 GiB. All owned runtime processes/services closed without reported cleanup errors.

**Evidence:** [Detailed report](../artifacts/phase0/20260929T091343.937322Z/report.md), [offline HTML](../artifacts/phase0/20260929T091343.937322Z/report.html), [validation review](phase0-validation.md).

**Known limitations:** Podman/Docker unavailable; no OS/container isolation claim. Only bundled local fixtures are allowed. No generated Python executes. Installed Chrome used after dedicated Chromium CDN timeouts. SmolVLM configured but not installed/downloaded/validated. Single-page, one-click integration does not establish UX detection, persona calibration, or broader navigation quality.

**What remains for Phase 0:** No required gate tasks. Optional dedicated-browser reproducibility and vision measurement remain deferred.

**Next after this gate:** Phase 1 contracts/configuration/fixtures, now completed below. Phases 2–3 must implement and validate container/network and generated-code boundaries before enabling arbitrary replica URLs or code agents. Do not treat the Phase 0 proxy as that boundary.

## Phase 1 — Complete (foundation and controlled fixtures)

**Date:** September 29, 2026.

**Delivered:** Importable `frictionlab` package and loopback startup command; Pydantic configuration, browser/action/evidence/protection/report contracts; 24 JSON Schemas; three profiles, three observable journeys, environment manifest and example run; offline reference resolution and configuration hash; six storefront variants; unique synthetic accounts; deterministic run-scoped reset; six local integration mocks and a rejected sentinel control; configuration review API; disabled browser execution with automatic JSON/Markdown/offline HTML partial reports; phase-scoped acceptance tests and setup/API guide.

**Acceptance:** 78 distinct checks passed. Construction preceded the initial consolidated pass. Initially 52 passed and 25 stopped at setup because the tripwire blocked Windows' event-loop socket pair. After correcting that harness issue, only the 25 affected checks were rerun, plus one new guard check. Ruff passed after two targeted style repairs; JavaScript syntax passed once. No Phase 0, browser, model, or full-suite repeat occurred.

**Protection result:** Configuration rejection, mock integrations, synthetic order review, and reset were validated with application connections/DNS denied in the test process. Standard-library internal socket pairs are explicitly permitted. No external website was contacted. This is not network/container protection validation; browser execution remains disabled.

**Evidence:** [Validation review](phase1-validation.md), [merged checks](../artifacts/phase1/validation.xml), [structured checkpoint](../artifacts/phase1/validation.json), [sample partial report](../artifacts/phase1/sample/92ae9513-2163-455d-9b5b-d41e68f5bbf9/report.md), [Phase 1 guide](phase1-foundation.md).

**What remains for Phase 1:** No required work. Rendered browser behavior and transport protection belong to Phase 2. In-memory data, lack of OS/container isolation, and absence of autonomous UX analysis remain explicitly documented limitations.

**Next:** Phase 2 browser observation/execution and replica-only traffic. Do not enable external targets or generated code based on Phase 1's configuration checks.

## Later phases

Phases 0–6 have completed their documented owned-fixture gates. Phases 7–10 have not started. The generated-code/container boundary passed on a disposable GitHub runner; local generated-code mode remains blocked without a supported container runtime.

## Phase 2 — Complete (owned-fixture browser/proxy gate)

**Date:** September 29, 2026.

**Delivered:** Playwright broker and same-target browser-use/CDP grounding; typed observe/act/verify tools; fresh candidate/document identity and stale-element rejection; viewport/touch/keyboard/page-scale support; independent completion criteria; masked screenshots, sanitized DOM/ARIA, offline marks and coordinate mapping; focus/validation/frame/network evidence; endpoint/payload-aware fixed-upstream gateway and independent sentinel controls; request/concurrency/step/runtime limits, cancellation and cleanup; pinned offline axe-core scanner/provenance/licenses; deterministic browser demo; 26 contract schemas; detailed terminal reports and validation guide.

**Acceptance:** 83 distinct passing checks: 34 new Phase 2 checks and 49 relevant regressions. Construction preceded the initial consolidated pass. Browser callback, service-worker check, and screenshot caret-state issues were repaired with browser-only/fail-fast checks. After successful acceptance, report review added a specific startup-failure reason and targeted terminal-report checks. Passing full suites, policy checks, Phase 0, model calls, and JavaScript checks were not repeated. Lint passes.

**Protection result:** Across all 43 retained lifecycle reports, including failed attempts, the independent sentinel received zero requests and its seeded data stayed unchanged. Accepted sessions enforced the example two-request/second and one-upstream-concurrency ceilings and cleaned up their owned services, synthetic data, and temporary profiles. Supported scope is the bundled fixture/browser/proxy boundary only; external replicas and generated code remain disabled.

**Observed demos:** Mouse, mobile touch, and keyboard/page-scale paths all completed independent checkout-review criteria. Known defects produced saved validation/no-change/delay/cost/focus evidence; they were not labeled as human churn. Stored desktop screenshot was visually reviewed with input masking intact.

**Evidence:** [Validation review](phase2-validation.md), [structured checkpoint](../artifacts/phase2/validation.json), [browser guide](phase2-browser.md), [mouse report](../artifacts/phase2/runs/2c2625a0-d23f-4481-9a3d-14778f01764c/report.html), [mobile report](../artifacts/phase2/runs/3038617b-04b6-4b7a-99b0-81c3b0360f3c/report.html), [keyboard report](../artifacts/phase2/runs/2574e908-5191-4a52-bbaf-8340d5874366/report.html).

**What remains for Phase 2:** No required tasks in its supported fixture gate. OS/container isolation is unavailable; frame/popup/shadow-root/download actions and real assistive technology are unsupported. Installed Chrome is recorded but unpinned. These limits remain explicit and must be addressed before expanding execution scope.

**Next:** Phase 3 single autonomous persona. Validate the stronger code-worker boundary before executing generated Python. Cognitive runtime, detectors, orchestration, durable telemetry, calibrated UX reports/heatmaps, and dashboard remain later work.

## Phase 3 — Complete for the owned-fixture scope

**Date:** September 30, 2026 (Asia/Kuala_Lumpur; raw artifact timestamps use UTC).

**Delivered:** Locked smolagents 1.26.0; shared owned llama.cpp/Qwen adapter with checksum, token, request, and sampled memory limits; ToolCallingAgent with only trusted browser/final tools; three profile prompts; isolated bounded persona memory; viewport/keyboard observation filtering; declared synthetic text references; action/tool/step/runtime/retry ceilings; independent goal assertions; fail-closed generated-code mode; autonomous CLI; detailed decision/terminal reports; acceptance harness and guide.

**Acceptance:** 100 distinct checks pass: 48 Phase 3 checks and 52 relevant report/contract/protection regressions. Construction preceded the initial consolidated pass. That batch passed 85/88 checks; all three initial healthy model journeys failed the declared 3/3 threshold. Repairs reran only affected/new checks. Passing enterprise/mobile browser-model executions were not repeated; mobile's corrected privacy assertion was reviewed from saved evidence only. The final three configuration-rejection checks ran offline. Changed Python files pass Ruff.

**Results:** Latest independently verified outcomes cover all three profiles: enterprise delivery information in one model-selected action, mobile checkout review in 16, keyboard checkout in 11. Ten real healthy attempts across successive implementation versions produced three completions; all failures remain recorded. These are capability checks, not calibrated conversion rates. Reports record 84 model decisions. The keyboard success used 153.096 seconds of model processing, 2.595 seconds of application processing, and 5.163 GiB peak sampled model RSS.

**Protection/report review:** All 19 terminal outcomes exported detailed JSON, Markdown, and offline HTML reports. Three preflight rejections started no browser/model/sentinel and made zero target requests; the other 16 retained reports show zero sentinel requests and unchanged sentinel data. Owned browser profiles/services and the shared model owner were cleaned up. Review used stored evidence, including a visually inspected mobile terminal screenshot showing Order review and no order placed. No external website, generated Python, or vision model was used.

**Targeted fixes:** Independent completion ends the agent immediately; unverified finish is unavailable. Real scroll movement counts as progress. Keyboard actions require applicable grounded focus, historical memory excludes stale control/dialog markup, and Escape requires a current dialog. The native model cache is capped at 512 MiB; credential/tool environment overrides are stripped; memory termination is classified as infrastructure failure. Invalid configuration, selections, and agent settings now export preflight reports without execution.

**September 30 completion attempt:** Constructed an OCI-side generated-code process, a rootless Podman launcher with immutable local image ID and no network/host mounts, a bounded stdio action channel to the trusted broker, a pinned-base `Containerfile`, and the `smolagents.CodeAgent` source adapter. The runner requires a matching host/image boundary gate before model or browser startup. Twenty new offline worker/adapter checks and two existing blocked-mode guards pass; targeted lint passes. This is source-level construction, not a validated sandbox. A fresh host check still found no Podman, Docker, or installed WSL.

**Remote completion:** The manual [GitHub Actions run](https://github.com/TEE123754/Agentic/actions/runs/36704845110) passed on an ephemeral Ubuntu runner. All 14 real-container boundary checks passed for its rootless Podman worker image, including network/host isolation, resource limits, unapproved code, stale/forged IPC, timeout, cleanup, and untouched sentinel. The CodeAgent then executed generated Python in that worker and completed the owned healthy delivery/returns journey in one model decision and one browser action. The saved JSON/Markdown/offline HTML report was reviewed without repeating navigation. It records zero sentinel requests, unchanged sentinel data, and owned-service cleanup. The terminal screenshot visibly shows the delivery and returns policy. Local [boundary review](../artifacts/phase3/remote-36704845110/worker-boundary-review.md), [journey review](../artifacts/phase3/remote-36704845110/code-journey-review.md), and [report](../artifacts/phase3/remote-36704845110/runs/49824634-7fd8-4b5d-8fde-24becbb00f8e/report.html) are retained. Failed remote attempts remain recorded in the implementation plan.

**Remaining scope:** No required Phase 3 owned-fixture gate work remains. This laptop still has no Podman, Docker, or WSL, so its local `isolated_code` mode stays blocked; the GitHub acceptance record is valid only on its runner/image. The terminal report is explicitly partial because calibrated UX findings/heatmaps and cohort orchestration belong to later phases. External replica support, optional vision, real assistive technology, cohorts, full UX reports, and dashboard remain deferred. [Worker checkpoint](phase3-code-worker.md).

**Evidence:** [Acceptance review](phase3-validation.md), [structured results](../artifacts/phase3/validation.json), [merged checks](../artifacts/phase3/validation.xml), [autonomous guide](phase3-autonomous.md), [mobile report](../artifacts/phase3/runs/204a3c49-dca9-4e48-a473-aeaf25fb46a2/report.html), [keyboard report](../artifacts/phase3/runs/f192ad61-4aba-456b-b1e7-aab860d3b423/report.html), [enterprise report](../artifacts/phase3/runs/8271c88e-eaeb-4ee2-94a0-ef92a15fa963/report.html).

## Phase 4 — Complete for the owned-fixture cognitive gate

**Date:** September 30, 2026 (Asia/Kuala_Lumpur).

**Delivered:** Versioned deterministic friction settings; evidence-backed detectors for dead interaction, unclear validation, repeated failed correction, navigation loop, loading failure, and keyboard trap; bounded profile-weighted patience ledger with milestone credit and retry deduplication; first-person evidence-template diagnosis at patience exhaustion; an opt-in Phase 4 behavioral runner/CLI; and detailed terminal report contracts/sections. Infrastructure, protection, and model failures remain separate outcomes.

**Acceptance check:** One consolidated post-construction batch passed 104/104 checks. Five new final-review checks brought the merged total to **109/109**. A protected-control harness assumption failed once, was repaired, and only that affected check was rerun. Dialog-attribution and information-memory repairs were also checked with targeted new/affected checks. Original raw failures/reports remain. Passing matched browser journeys were not repeated.

**Result:** The seeded mobile `dead_button` journey abandoned at 55 → 0 patience after a grounded dead click, with confidence 0.94, final evidence, and a first-person synthetic explanation. The matched healthy checkout completed in five actions with no friction; delayed feedback completed without a false loading failure. Timeout/invalid model output stayed inconclusive and did not count as churn. These matched actions used a deterministic semantic-control smolagents harness. Two additional real local-Qwen defect attempts were retained: the first timed out after repeatedly reopening delivery information and generated two false navigation-loop events without an abandonment claim; after detector/memory repairs, the second reached the dead button in six model decisions and produced one valid dead-click abandonment. Neither outcome is a calibrated success rate.

**Protection/report review:** Ten Phase 4 terminal reports, one protected-control probe, and one information-dialog probe report were retained. Ten initialized sentinel reports recorded zero requests and unchanged data; the unexecuted preflight rejection made zero target requests. Report exports and evidence links resolved. Saved dead/healthy/repaired-Qwen screenshots were reviewed offline, showing no order or external dispatch. No external website, generated Python, or vision call occurred.

**Known limitations / next:** The gate covers one owned fixture and synthetic profiles, not calibrated human abandonment or robust model performance across seeds. Broader false-positive evaluation and human review remain. Phase 3's generated-code path passed only on a remote host/image; external replicas and local generated code remain disabled. Phase 5 cohorts/DuckDB/persistence and later aggregate UX reports/heatmaps/dashboard have not started. No required Phase 4 fixture-gate work remains.

**Evidence:** [Validation review](phase4-validation.md), [structured results](../artifacts/phase4/validation.json), [merged checks](../artifacts/phase4/validation.xml), [behavioral guide](phase4-cognition.md), [repaired local-Qwen report](../artifacts/phase4/runs/13e8b5a3-e09f-487a-8ee1-c6432d63c4ae/report.html), [original timed-out Qwen report](../artifacts/phase4/runs/88d69f16-357d-44bd-8061-cd6b447a32e2/report.html), [matched healthy report](../artifacts/phase4/runs/7bb91b99-f9a3-46dd-a1e6-fbfe8eb202f8/report.html).

## Phase 5 — Complete for the owned-fixture cohort gate

**Date:** September 30, 2026 (Asia/Kuala_Lumpur).

**Delivered:** Bounded owned-fixture cohort coordinator; run/session status, cancellation, and explicit linked retry API; separate browser/profile/fixture namespaces, seed, planner memory, and evidence directories; global traffic and fixture-health budget; DuckDB projections and fsynced replayable JSONL journal; interrupted-session recovery; local OpenTelemetry span export; atomic, recoverable partial aggregate reports linking individual reports; offline reviewer and manual GitHub Actions workflow. Pinned DuckDB and OpenTelemetry SDK. Default one worker minimizes local resource use.

**Protection:** Cohort execution is enabled only on the local `serve` API and only for registered bundled fixtures. Each nested browser fixture still disables cohort endpoints. Existing deny-by-default browser/proxy boundaries, synthetic accounts, and run-owned cleanup remain. No production website or external replica is supported.

**Acceptance and review:** The [remote gate](https://github.com/TEE123754/Agentic/actions/runs/36711155345) passed **57/57** checks, including the two-browser cohort; one enterprise session completed order review and one mobile session was cancelled, with distinct browser/profile/account/fixture state. Its partial report shows 2 executed, 1 eligible, 13 fixture requests, peak 2 requests/s and 1 concurrent upstream request, zero sentinel requests, unchanged sentinel data, and two OpenTelemetry session spans. The terminal screenshot was visually reviewed: no order was placed. Saved report links, journal, and DuckDB were reviewed without reopening the browser. After the remote batch, targeted local checks passed for interrupted-session retry plus Phase 1 report regressions (**16/16**) and cohort health-stop classification (**1/1**); the full browser batch was not repeated.

**Remaining scope:** No required Phase 5 owned-fixture gate work remains. The aggregate report is factual and partial; calibrated UX findings, heatmaps, and remediation advice remain Phase 6. Two-worker live-Qwen throughput and arbitrary staging sites are not validated. [Operator guide](phase5-cohorts.md); [detailed validation record](phase5-validation.md); [saved offline review](../artifacts/phase5/remote-36711155345/validation-review.md).

## Phase 6 — Complete for the owned-fixture audit gate

**Date:** September 30, 2026 (Asia/Kuala_Lumpur).

**Built:** Offline validator for saved session/observation/event evidence; grouped findings with eligible denominators, confidence and severity rationale, remediation and verification; synthetic click heatmaps with masked screenshot backgrounds and repeated-failure clusters; milestone funnels, trajectory indexes, exclusions, first-person diagnosis checks, and detailed JSON/Markdown/offline HTML. Durable revision-2 finalization follows the existing revision-1 fallback. Local human finding dispositions create later immutable revisions; the API serves latest and explicit versions. Recovery retains a prior good export when later review fails. The implementation and reviewer use only local files and DuckDB, never the website during report synthesis.

**Acceptance and review:** Contract schemas exported; Ruff passed. The [initial remote acceptance run](https://github.com/TEE123754/Agentic/actions/runs/36718564621) passed **39/39** checks, covering completed, abandoned, cancelled, blocked, failed, interrupted, malformed evidence, synthesis failure, human review, relevant regressions, and a two-browser owned-fixture defect cohort. A later [affected-only Phase 6 gate](https://github.com/TEE123754/Agentic/actions/runs/36722154919) passed **14/14** checks after report-fidelity hardening: direct evidence/data links, screenshot dimension checks, pixel-compatible heatmaps, partial status for excluded clicks, and missing-asset fallback/recovery. Its new two-browser report again shows 2/2 eligible synthetic abandonments, one supported Start checkout finding, one heatmap, and zero exclusions. The masked screenshot and report were reviewed offline. The manifest uses only a loopback origin; sentinel received zero requests and its data was unchanged. The review path makes no target requests.

**What remains:** No required Phase 6 owned-fixture gate work. External staging targets need an independently validated no-impact replica boundary; calibrated human churn claims and the Phase 7 dashboard remain outside this gate. [Phase 6 guide](phase6-audits.md); [detailed validation record](phase6-validation.md); [latest saved offline audit](../artifacts/phase6/remote-36722154919/7fba3ea7-10d6-40c2-9c43-89e827e3e762/reports/69c52003-b811-4c93-9dce-62cb6ce4e14e/revisions/2/report.html).

## Phase 7 — Complete for the owned-fixture dashboard gate

**Date:** September 30, 2026 (Asia/Kuala_Lumpur).

**Built:** Optional Streamlit/Plotly local command center with bounded fixture-only cohort setup, live status/cancellation, stored trajectory and masked screenshot views, compatible synthetic heatmaps, findings with remediation and verification, human dispositions, and complete JSON/Markdown/HTML report downloads. The dashboard uses only loopback FastAPI routes and saved run assets; it does not open the tested page for review. An operator guide, one remote acceptance walkthrough, and an offline evidence reviewer are included.

**Acceptance:** The [initial remote batch](https://github.com/TEE123754/Agentic/actions/runs/36727805142) passed the existing Phase 6 human-review regression; its Phase 7 UI check failed on a hidden-tab text locator. An [affected-only rerun](https://github.com/TEE123754/Agentic/actions/runs/36728402840) exposed the same locator ambiguity. The [final affected-only gate](https://github.com/TEE123754/Agentic/actions/runs/36729027247) passed **1/1** complete dashboard walkthrough in 21.98 seconds. The saved screenshot was visually inspected. The final revision-4 report contains one eligible synthetic abandonment, one supported finding, one heatmap, and a confirmed human review. The sentinel recorded zero requests and unchanged data; report review did not revisit the target.

**Remaining scope:** No required Phase 7 fixture-gate work. Only the registered local fixture is executable; arbitrary staging targets need a separately validated no-impact replica boundary. Human-churn calibration, broader evaluation, static sharing, and release validation remain Phases 8–10. [Operator guide](phase7-dashboard.md); [validation record](phase7-validation.md); [saved offline review](../artifacts/phase7/remote-36729027247/phase7-owned-fixture-dashboard-evidence/validation-review.md).

## Phase 8 — Complete for the frozen owned-fixture evaluation gate

**Date:** September 30, 2026 (Asia/Kuala_Lumpur).

**Built:** SHA-pinned, split-aware Mind2Web offline JSON projection and action scorer; frozen two-seed healthy/dead-button fixture labels; order-reversed matched cohorts with strict comparability checks; raw count, outcome, finding/confidence, evidence-completeness, and observed-protection comparison; Streamlit Comparison tab and API; human-review rubric; one private GitHub Actions gate and offline evidence reviewer. Raw Mind2Web examples are never placed in fixture planner prompts or uploaded as artifacts.

**Acceptance:** The [remote gate](https://github.com/TEE123754/Agentic/actions/runs/36734421811) passed **3/3** checks in one batch. Four ready fixture reports yielded two defect → healthy comparisons, each with +1 synthetic completion and a resolved seeded finding. On the frozen two-positive/two-negative batch, healthy completion, high-severity precision, seeded-blocker detection, and finding evidence-reference validity were 100%; all sentinel counts were zero and data remained unchanged. The saved comparison screenshot was visually reviewed; dashboard review made no fixture-route request. The pinned Mind2Web training-shard smoke covered nine tasks/49 steps, and the untuned lexical reference achieved only 3/46 grounded element selections and 0/9 full tasks. Those poor diagnostic scores are retained and are not attributed to the browser planner.

**Remaining scope:** No required Phase 8 owned-fixture gate work. The small deterministic batch does not calibrate human UX or establish model-driven navigation quality. Held-out official Mind2Web scoring of the actual planner, broader labels/seeds/personas, arbitrary protected staging replicas, and subsequent sharing/release validation remain. [Operator guide](phase8-evaluation.md); [validation record](phase8-validation.md); [saved offline review](../artifacts/phase8/remote-36734421811/phase8-owned-fixture-evaluation-evidence/validation-review.md).


## Phase 9 - Complete for offline sharing

**Date:** October 2, 2026 (Asia/Kuala_Lumpur).

**Delivered:** Local `export-static`, sanitized bounded JSON, self-contained viewer with filters/playback/heatmaps/report view, private browser import, public synthetic example and optional Static Space instructions. Quota policy remains disabled; cloud transports are not shipped.

**Acceptance:** Two distinct checks verified: mocked quota guard passed in the initial batch; the [final affected offline walkthrough](https://github.com/TEE123754/Agentic/actions/runs/36889073326) passed 1/1 in 21.90 seconds. Test path and mobile layout defects were repaired. Screenshot review found heatmap distortion; its repair and geometry assertion passed before completion. Final screenshot and offline reviewer inspected. No HTTP requests during review; zero sentinel traffic and unchanged data recorded. No local browser/model tests or full-suite repetition.

**Remaining:** None for the declared gate. Optional publication was not performed. See [validation record](phase9-validation.md).

## Phase 10 - Complete for Linux installation and mocked BYOK

**Date:** October 2, 2026 (Asia/Kuala_Lumpur).

**Delivered:** Installable FrictionLab 0.1.0 console/wheel/source, bundled local assets, init/doctor, one-worker fixture cohort CLI, opt-in Groq/Gemini adapters with environment keys at that phase (native credential storage was added in Phase 12), sanitized bounded semantic inputs, shared inference budget/runtime/retries/quota pause, provider provenance and strict comparison rejection. Source README/site/operator guide, third-party notices and downloadable development archives are included.

**Acceptance:** [Initial batch](https://github.com/TEE123754/Agentic/actions/runs/36892800838) passed 48/48 checks in 33.21 seconds plus isolated installed-wheel/browser acceptance. [Installed navigation](https://github.com/TEE123754/Agentic/actions/runs/36893880901) passed without review HTTP requests. Review found invalid inference preflight could escape terminal reporting; settings were frozen at submission and the [affected cohort repair](https://github.com/TEE123754/Agentic/actions/runs/36894867219) passed 2/2 in 42.77 seconds. Overall 49 distinct pytest cases, plus installed CLI/browser/navigation, are verified. Defect abandoned, healthy completed, seeded finding resolved; reports were ready with valid references. Sentinel zero traffic/data unchanged. Screenshot/advice, archive contents/checksums and all 151 evidence files including DuckDB reviewed offline; no synthetic key marker. No heavy local tests/model downloads.

**Remaining:** No required work for this declared gate. Live account/model API smoke and actual model behavior need the operator's own eligible free key; clean Windows/macOS archive installation, public publication, arbitrary isolated replicas and human calibration remain unverified. Phase 11 consolidated release validation remains unchecked. [Validation](phase10-validation.md); [setup guide](phase10-installation.md).

## Phase 11 - Complete for the owned-fixture release gate

**Historical initial window (superseded by the final receipt below):** Built release operations, workspace-aware setup, license/pin review, full-regression/installed-wheel workflow and real three-profile pilot. The single full regression (https://github.com/TEE123754/Agentic/actions/runs/36896802260) returned 249 passed and 4 failed in 1615.56 seconds. Two healthy planner journeys and the pilot missed runtime limits on the free CPU runner; pilot reports remain partial with zero sentinel traffic, unchanged data and no abandonment diagnosis. A legacy-manifest recovery KeyError is repaired; the affected follow-up (https://github.com/TEE123754/Agentic/actions/runs/36901248316) passed 20/20 in 41.50 seconds plus installed-wheel/browser/landing acceptance. Report/screenshot/license/archive review and illustrative partial examples are complete. Overall 250 distinct checks pass and three real-model cases remain unresolved. Remaining: resolve real planner latency/completion, pass those three selectors and rebuild the final candidate. See [validation record](phase11-validation.md). Phase 11 stays unchecked. No laptop models/containers installed, no public release, and external sites stay blocked.

### Final Phase 11 receipt

[36956658903](https://github.com/TEE123754/Agentic/actions/runs/36956658903) passed 71/71 in 1319.509 seconds plus installed-wheel acceptance; 265 distinct regression cases pass across full/affected windows. Healthy real checkout: ready, 3/3 completed/no missing evidence. Defect baseline: partial, one grounded mobile abandonment, two excluded planner faults. Reviewed latest reports, comparison, exports, portable screenshot, archives and cleanup; zero sentinel requests and unchanged data. Earlier unresolved statements are historical. See [complete validation receipt](phase11-validation.md).

## Phases 12–13 - Historical construction window

The shared FastAPI/vanilla dashboard, six-category static catalog, zero-contact URL/snapshots, separately approved single-GET capture, offline renderer, axe/viewports, scores/coverage/confidence, progress/cancel/recovery and JSON/MD/HTML/ZIP reports are built. CLI `frictionlab start` prints localhost; Tkinter desktop provides masked key setup and service launch/open/stop. Keys use process memory or explicitly selected native OS keyring, with no plaintext fallback. AI only suggests fixes for measured findings; active/dynamic checks need a verified replica or source/access and are skipped here.

[36959441855](https://github.com/TEE123754/Agentic/actions/runs/36959441855) returned 51 passed/one Linux dashboard timeout. Windows native/package receipt is under review. Neither phase is ticked until required acceptance succeeds. See [setup and scope](local-assessment.md) and the implementation plan. No laptop browser/model tests, package installs or containers run for these phases.

### Phase 12 completion receipt

[Initial 36959441855](https://github.com/TEE123754/Agentic/actions/runs/36959441855) had 51/52 passes. [Affected 36961176346](https://github.com/TEE123754/Agentic/actions/runs/36961176346) passed 3/3 and the installed-wheel dashboard/export smoke. Reviewed saved real Chrome dashboard/snapshot screenshots, report counts (5 passed, 11 failed, 7 skipped, 0 incomplete), scores (31 overall, 70% coverage), axe/viewport issues, reproduction and limitations. The zero-contact sentinel received no requests. Phase 12 is checked for this offline/static capability. Phase 13 was still awaiting Windows archive acceptance at that point; its final receipt follows.

### Phase 13 completion and Phase 14 publication

[36961560859](https://github.com/TEE123754/Agentic/actions/runs/36961560859) passed two Windows native checks and the extracted portable executable self-check/local dashboard/offline Chromium/axe/report smoke after Git pinned the minified axe resource as binary. The saved report shows zero target requests and three viewport screenshots. Phase 13's Windows gate is complete; macOS/Linux frozen downloads are not qualified. Phase 14 is preparing public MIT source, durable Release assets and a static landing page. No real provider key, production site or personal data was used in acceptance.

### Phase 14 completion receipt

The MIT [source](https://github.com/TEE123754/Agentic) is public. [Release v0.1.0](https://github.com/TEE123754/Agentic/releases/tag/v0.1.0) contains the qualified Windows ZIP, Python wheel, source archive and combined SHA256SUMS; local and GitHub digests match. The [Pages workflow](https://github.com/TEE123754/Agentic/actions/runs/36962346221) deployed the [product landing](https://tee123754.github.io/Agentic/) and [synthetic sample](https://tee123754.github.io/Agentic/examples/phase9-static/index.html), both verified HTTP 200. Tracked history was reviewed for credential patterns before publication: seven fixture-only matches, no real key found. The repository homepage points to the landing. Public distribution does not change the static/offline assessment scope or permit active testing of deployed products.

## Phases 15–17 — local development checkpoint, October 5

Phase 15's offline replica declaration check is built and always blocks external execution until independent backend/data/integration and egress isolation is established. The operator chose bundled fixtures only. Phase 16's Morpheus account connection smoke used its one authorized bounded request; interactive real-model and optional local-planner qualification remain open.

The shared CLI/desktop localhost dashboard now supports bounded synthetic fixture-agent jobs with persona/goal/variant selection, cost acknowledgement, status/stop, saved outcomes and JSON/Markdown/HTML/ZIP reports. The [initial workspace gate](https://github.com/TEE123754/FrictionLab/actions/runs/37324017439) passed 67 Linux cases. The [final affected execution gate](https://github.com/TEE123754/FrictionLab/actions/runs/37333955041) passed eight Phase 17 cases, installed-wheel/export/archive checks, Windows native tests and real-browser fixture journeys from the extracted executable. Scripted provider responses yielded healthy goal completion and a grounded dead-button patience abandonment, zero sentinel traffic, unchanged sentinel data and cleanup. The reports, terminal screenshots and complete evidence ZIP were reviewed. No additional real inference or paid request was made.

These results qualify the fixture-only milestone on `codex/phase17-local-readiness`. Phases 15–17 remain unchecked for their broader supported-replica and real-model gates. Public v0.1.0 predates this panel; no new public release or deployment was made. Phase 18 stays deferred. See the [implementation plan](../IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) and [readiness record](phase17-release-readiness.md) for exact remaining work.
